            <h2>Ecz-Care is a website dedicated to spreading awareness about eczema, offering guidance for those navigating their own journey with the condition, and connecting individuals to organizations that can provide additional help. It serves both people living with eczema who need support and resources, as well as those who want to contribute to the eczema community or healthcare causes more broadly. The site was created by Brendan and Nathan, who personally experienced the challenges of severe eczema—especially during high school—and understand the toll it can take when self-advocacy is weak. Motivated by a desire to prevent others from suffering in silence, they built Ez-Care to foster community, encourage research, and offer potential relief to those in need.</h2>
