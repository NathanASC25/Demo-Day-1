            <p>Greetings! We are Ecz-care. Our purpose is to further spread awareness of Eczema, <br> also mainly known as Atopic Dermatitis. Eczema is a debilitating, inflammatory skin disease <br> that can take a toll on both a person's physical and mental health. <br><br> We cater to those who especially suffer from eczema themselves by encouraging them to take <br> advantage of the resources posted in the self-advocacy tab. We also encourage people to <br> stand up for others who need assistance. <br><br> In the future, we hope to boost funding not just for eczema research but also for other <br> conditions such as asthma.</p>
